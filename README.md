# Baseline Models

This repository tests baseline models and feature engineering combinations. Current baselines include Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and neural networks, and the codebase focuses on supervised learning. Data cleaning and feature packaging are not included here and will be released in a separate repository.

Special thanks to the Claude agent for better modulization, but you really need to tell it the struture yourself in detail of it'll mess up some important paths and logs.
